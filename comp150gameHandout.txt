

- Take the role of a time traveller tasked with retrieving famous artefacts from throughout time.

- Each level will denote a different time period in Earths past (or future!) using simple themes 
	and exaggerated enemies all hand drawn in pixel art for a classic look. Challenges from 
	time periods will include retrieving a Tyrannosaur tooth from a dinosaur ridden jungle, 
	fighting nazis in WW2 time Germany, and even help fend off an alien invasion in the future.

- Gameplay will vary per level: from defeating increasingly difficult waves of enemies before 
	facing a final boss battle, to stealth (sneak past the guards), to puzzle solving.

- There is a large established fan base for 2.5D top down games, and success stories include ...
	# (list some games inc that shooter we looked at in class)
	Hyper Light Drifter, the original zelda games, and the original pokemon games (the latter
	few of which influence the choice of using pixel art.
	
- The simplistic art and sound style of each level and it's enemies allow a strong focus by us 
	the developers on perfecting other elements of the gameplay like controls, balance, and 
	difficulty, while the open ended nature of the protaganists task allow great scope in 
	storytelling and plot, both centric to each time level and overall throughout the game.

- Key features that our development will revolve around include: simple and intuitive controls 
	for movement and aiming, retaining aesthetic freedom to represent whichever time period
	or genre we choose per level, and using random seeds and weighted percentages in level 
	creation and enemy behaviour to ensure replayability given that no two playthroughs will 
	be the same.
