5 plans are proposed, specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time bound
mastery of reflective writing, eloquent, fair, and constructive tone
spelling and grammar
structure: underlying the key skills, well constructed intro and conclusion, well constructed sentences and paragraphs

For the weekly CPD:
(a) Progress has been described with adequate detail; 
(b) Problems and issues have been clearly explained and assessed;

Lego robot olympiad
A lot of fun. Visual programming, although limited, is very satisfying in the way that it produces immediate results without having to worry about compiling or debugging. Deciding to learn intuitively lead to a structured rigor with the 'code' which led to practices like using a distance to wheel rotation ratio modifier, and mapping the exact turning command increments to the correct angles which helped to speed up subsequent challenges. Limitations with the accuracy and consistency of the lego motors exponentially increased margins of error with each subsequent command so we looked to use the supplied board markers as waypoints to fine tune the later stages of each program. Again the pysical limitations affected the implementation of the theories and it became obvious whilst watching the other groups that a brute force method of mapping the ideal path rather than calculating it gave many more succesful results, given the generous time leeway in the final assessment.
Fascinated with the chance to learn a new language, I took early responsibility of the programming itself. Gaining an early understanding kept me in this role which may have been unfair on the others in my team. Although I made an effort to walk them through my thought processes as often as possible, I regret perhaps being the reason that they may have not left the experience with the same learning and satisfaction that I received.
Lessons learned where mainly to not rely upon the physical elements of a machine (a group is only as strong as its weakest member), to define different but equally as important roles within the team, and to plan the project around the assesment criteria (were we only allowed one attempt at each challenge then our more stringent ideas may have been applicable). 


From game concepts to game design
A free for all frankly. In our group as the others there was no structure to the planning stages. Conversations would evaporate into jokes and tangents and with many voices and not many ideas. The earlier stages of this task demonstrated to me the extreme end of the scale where there is no proper process and very little direction in the form of one vague idea: to create a board game. I was surprised with the ease that the design process would not just slow down but stop entirely despite members trying to start it again, only with the introduction of a 'crunch' time did the team start to pull together.
Within all of the group projects I am starting to notice a trend. That the more people involved tends to the less work achieved. In smaller groups of two to three it is a lot easier to fluidly bounce araound ideas and quickly confirm or dismiss them, as opposed to having to wait your turn or have your voice drowned out in a larger group. Perhaps it is personal to me, but I find that I prefer to work with the same small group for as long as possible, building a rapport and learning each others strengths, rather than swapping between or mixing up teams. There is already beginning to emerge a small group with which I prefer to work.
I wonder if there is an optimum team size, and at what point would that change? Perhaps smaller groups are better suited to design, and larger for manufacture? Perhaps it is the other way around? Maybe the type of person involved has a greater effect? Would a team of three highly charismatic people perform better than three that are not so much? Perhaps the better rapport between team members allows a better flow of ideas and communication, or does it encourage the collapse of the process into discussing social and unrelated items?


Agile game development
Today began with another group task, in which we all began to structure ourself a little more accordingly. Two sub groups were formed to speed up development, although in hindsight it may have been too early; before even the design had been finalised. As such, we had two groups working in parallel on slightly different themes without realising it at first. This was quickly rectified but also easily avoidable if a more structured process was adhered to.
A suggestion of a better process came in the afternoons lecture. Whilst I compare defining processes like these to defining common sense, I can recognise the use of spelling out a process so there is no confusion in the team as to the process. It seems strange in a group of highly intelligent people to not rely upon their intelligence and intuition, but perhaps it is my own experience of having had to work within a team for so long that has tempered that intuition. In my experience, a great driving force in improving a teams cohesion and subsequent productivity is with the pressure of time (observed in the previous weeks crunch time effect), and as a direct result of good management. Both of which were lacking in this weeks task, with an open ended goal and no defined group leader. The Agile philosophy addresses both of these factors and demands their use, even in open ended projects, by relying upon sprints and scrums for time management and goal definition. By way of defining common sense I assume this philosophy is applicable to any project, but I wonder if it is applicable to any team? Is there a demograph to which this method proves ineffective, or would you simply redefine the parameters, the length or interval of the sprint for instance, to suit each person per task?

Game Version control
At last some 'gritty coding' (by my novice standards at least). Python is proving to be a very approachable and flexible language to work with, and pygames included functions ensure easy implementation of ideas. Perhaps a little too much. I freely admit to putting off my necessary written work: my research journal, and this CPD task included, to tinker with what I am starting to understand. What began as the standard 'Hello World' introduction led me to stay up late making a 'Zombie Sniper' game, and the arbitary task of recreating Pong to demonstrate Github's use, led similarly to being unable to leave it unfinished, and another night forgoing my assignments.
When we began work on our pre production tasks and assignments project, we fairly quickly formed a small group to discuss ideas. Recognising that this was the ultimate goal of the project ipso facto the entire module, I was surprised that more students did not do the same. My lack of creative thinking came quickly to light as I scrapped each of my ideas in favour of others, and it felt reassuring not to knowingly waste my time on a project that I knew would not come to fruition. Sadly the world is not ready for an armoured weaponised cat to infiltrate Buckingham Palace just yet.
