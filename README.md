## Week 1

Weekly journal goes here. Reflect.

Lego robot olympiad
A lot of fun. Visual programming, although very limited, is very satisfying to see immediate results  without having to worry about compiling or debugging. Deciding to learn intuitively lead to a structured rigor with the 'code' which led to practices like using a distance to wheel-rotation ratio modifier, and mapping the exact turning command increments to the correct angles which helped to speed up subsequent program challenges. Limitations with the accuracy and consistency of the lego motors exponentially increased margins of error with each subsequent command so we looked to use the supplied board markers as waypoints to fine tune the later stages of each program. Again the pysical limitations affected the implementation of the theorys and it became obvious whilst watching the other groups that a brute force method of mapping the ideal path rather than calculating it gave many more succesful results, given the generous time leeway factor in the final assessment. Lessons learned where mainly to not rely upon the physical elements (a group is only as strong as its weakest member), and to plan the project around the assesment criteria (were we only allowed one attempt at each challenge then our more stringent ideas may have been applicable).


From game concepts to game design
A free for all frankly. In our group as the others there was no structure to the planning stages. Conversations would evaporate into jokes and tangents and with many voices and not many ideas. The earlier stages of this task demonstrated to me the extreme end of the scale where there is no proper process and very little direction in the form of one vague idea: to create a board game. I was surprised with the ease that the design process would not just slow down but stop entirely despite members trying to start it again, only with the introduction of a 'crunch' time did the team start to pull together. Within all of the group projects I am starting to notice a trend. That the more people involved tends to the less work achieved. In smaller groups of 2-3 it is a lot easier to fluidly bounce ideas around and quickly confirm or dismiss them, as opposed to having to wait your turn or be drowned out in a larger group. Perhaps it is personal to me, but I find that I prefer to work with the same small group for as long as possible, building a repoire and learning each others strengthes, rather than swapping between or mixing up teams.  Something I will certainly bear in mind in the future.
