Week one

A lot of fun. Visual programming, although limited, is very satisfying in the way that it produces immediate results without having to worry about compiling or debugging. Deciding to learn intuitively lead to a structured rigor with the 'code' which led to practices like using a distance to wheel rotation ratio modifier, and mapping the exact turning command increments to the correct angles which helped to speed up subsequent challenges. Limitations with the accuracy and consistency of the lego motors exponentially increased margins of error with each subsequent command so we looked to use the supplied board markers as waypoints to fine tune the later stages of each program. Again the pysical limitations affected the implementation of the theories and it became obvious whilst watching the other groups that a brute force method of mapping the ideal path rather than calculating it gave many more succesful results, given the generous time leeway in the final assessment.
Fascinated with the chance to learn a new language, I took early responsibility of the programming itself. Gaining an early understanding kept me in this role which may have been unfair on the others in my team. Although I made an effort to walk them through my thought processes as often as possible, I regret perhaps being the reason that they may have not left the experience with the same learning and satisfaction that I received.

Lessons learned where mainly to not rely upon the physical elements of a machine (a group is only as strong as its weakest member), to  rotate or define different but equally as important roles within the team, and to plan the project around the assesment criteria (were we only allowed one attempt at each challenge then our more stringent ideas may have been applicable). 


Week two

A free for all frankly. In our group as the others there was no structure to the planning stages. Conversations would evaporate into jokes and tangents and with many voices and not many ideas. The earlier stages of this task demonstrated to me the extreme end of the scale where there is no proper process and very little direction in the form of one vague idea: to create a board game. I was surprised with the ease that the design process would not just slow down but stop entirely despite members trying to start it again, only with the introduction of a 'crunch' time did the team start to pull together.


Within all of the group projects I am starting to notice a trend. That the more people involved tends to the less work achieved. In smaller groups of two to three it is a lot easier to fluidly bounce araound ideas and quickly confirm or dismiss them, as opposed to having to wait your turn or have your voice drowned out in a larger group. Perhaps it is personal to me, but I find that I prefer to work with the same small group for as long as possible, building a rapport and learning each others strengths, rather than swapping between or mixing up teams. There is already beginning to emerge a small group with which I prefer to work.

I wonder if there is an optimum team size, and at what point would that change? Perhaps smaller groups are better suited to design, and larger for manufacture? Perhaps it is the other way around? Maybe the type of person involved has a greater effect? Would a team of three highly charismatic people perform better than three that are not so much? Perhaps the better rapport between team members allows a better flow of ideas and communication, or does it encourage the collapse of the process into discussing social and unrelated items?


Week three

Today began with another group task, in which we all began to structure ourself a little more accordingly. Two sub groups were formed to speed up development, although in hindsight it may have been too early; before even the design had been finalised. As such, we had two groups working in parallel on slightly different themes without realising it at first. This was quickly rectified but also easily avoidable if a more structured process was adhered to.

A suggestion of a better process came in the afternoons lecture. Whilst I compare defining processes like these to defining common sense, I can recognise the use of spelling out a process so there is no confusion in the team as to the process. It seems strange in a group of highly intelligent people to not rely upon their intelligence and intuition, but perhaps it is my own experience of having had to work within a team for so long that has tempered that intuition. In my experience, a great driving force in improving a teams cohesion and subsequent productivity is with the pressure of time (observed in the previous weeks crunch time effect), and as a direct result of good management. Both of which were lacking in this weeks task, with an open ended goal and no defined group leader. The Agile philosophy addresses both of these factors and demands their use, even in open ended projects, by relying upon sprints and scrums for time management and goal definition. By way of defining common sense I assume this philosophy is applicable to any project, but I wonder if it is applicable to any team? Is there a demograph to which this method proves ineffective, or would you simply redefine the parameters, the length or interval of the sprint for instance, to suit each person per task?

Week four

At last some 'gritty coding' (by my novice standards at least). Python is proving to be a very approachable and flexible language to work with, and pygames included functions ensure easy implementation of ideas. Perhaps a little too much. I freely admit to putting off my necessary written work: my research journal, and this CPD task included, to tinker with what I am starting to understand. What began as the standard 'Hello World' introduction led me to stay up late making a 'Zombie Sniper' game, and the arbitary task of recreating Pong to demonstrate Github's use, led similarly to being unable to leave it unfinished, and another night forgoing my assignments.

When we began work on our pre production tasks and assignments project, we fairly quickly formed a small group to discuss ideas. Recognising that this was the ultimate goal of the project ipso facto the entire module, I was surprised that more students did not do the same. My lack of creative thinking came quickly to light as I scrapped each of my ideas in favour of others, and it felt reassuring not to knowingly waste my time on a project that I knew would not come to fruition. Sadly the world is not ready for an armoured weaponised cat to infiltrate Buckingham Palace just yet.

Week five

Everyone else seemed to struggle with understanding the maths principles shown in Ed's lecture although I found it all reassuringly accessible. I am quite comfortable with calculus and enjoyed the worksheet that followed, despite misreading a question and answering it incorrectly. The big O notation is the first real chance to analyse my own code in a meaningful way other than simply stating that it is messy, neat, or thoroughly commented and I hope that there are other gauges that will further this self analysis and direction. I get fascinated with the idea of unsolved mysteries and aim to read further on the P vs NP problem that Ed explained. Elsewhere I am still struggling to formulate a meaningful agile essay question but will continue to try and think of an original and meaningful topic.

Week six

This week involved a lot of self directed programming time so it is a little harder to think of any problems that have been faced. I get on well with the others involved in my project and we are all quite proactive with doing as much as we can. The big news is that we are all starting to become more proficient with github! This was a big issue for a while with many pushes and pulls resulting in failure messages and resorting to use other messenger programs such as discord instead. Knowing that the marking rubric clearly states using github for version control this was a worry for a while. I think I am at two whole days now without an unsuccessful pull/push!

Week seven

I have had some experience of arrays in c# so the leap to using lists in python was reasonably straightforward. I had not encountered or found the need to explore other data structures, so I found it interesting to explore these other methods like dictionarys and sets, both for my own satisfaction and the promise of higher sophistication marks once incorporated into my projects. For instance in the comp110 worksheet, where the aim was to create a noughts and crosses replica, I used a dictionary structure for the board as opposed to a list of lists which would have been my initial choice. I really enjoyed the worksheet as I was quite proud of my solution which addressed the extra criteria of a n * n board, differing win lengths, and more importantly did not uncannily resemble the first solution posted on github... I was surprised at the extent with which some of the other solutions were obviously researched from the same paper, given unused class fields and identical, sometimes unnecessary, variables. It seems strange that some did not work through the challenge but then again maybe they found it too difficult? I would have thought that everyone would have given it a try especially given the generous marking criteria for a pass, and that it really wasn't difficult at all. I joked to the original author I was offended that no one copied me.

Week eight

Code review week! It is a strange process... I have already found myself in the apparently typical programming mindset of never being happy that a project is completely finished. To be convinced that an additional feature or a better method is just one more hour of screen staring away. The strange part of the process is to see a code reviw note next to a section that you had previously believed fine. That the part to be improved was somewhere else entirely! This is brilliant though. It really feels like learning when you are not only being taught new things you are able to do, but also better ways to do the things you are already doing! This also opens up the chances to fill in gaps in your knowledge. Doc strings for example which I had seen before but had not been introduced to (I just thought the author was commenting their code in an inconsistent way), I understand now are a standard and have rigidly adhered to as part of my process, rather than the after thoughts for coherence that regular comments often are.
Thinking back to last weeks data structures I find myself facing an odd predicament. It has been made evident that incorporating a dictionary structure into a control scheme will gain marks for sophistication, however by it's nature it does not execute two controls at the same time. As I write this I think I have just figured it out... The current method will execute the first control then move on but if it would loop for the amount of times that on a full event check a relevent key returned '1'. then multiple movement fuctions could be called and the summaritive adjustments stacked in one frame. Will have to look into this - sorry probably not cpd relevant. My predicament was however what would I choose to do faced with the choice of a highly sophisticated method rife with bugs each requiring sophistication to ammend, vs a simple method using nested if statements despite having to be in the main game loop that frankly just works easily and first time. I think I would always choose the sophisticated method because of learning, pride, the challenge, and showing off, but is this correct when I know of an effective easy solution that works otherwise?

Week nine

Deadlines are starting to loom a little more readily now with one assignment already handed in and a number more due in the next few weeks. Whilst I don't believe that I suffer from poor time management, there is certainly more pressure now than ever before to manage priorities. Whilst I would greatly enjoy going back through the com110 worksheets to perfect them I have to accept that my research journal is lacking and my progress with the agile essay is significantly worse. Luckily with some foresight I have some free time approaching with which I can bring any work that has fallen behind back up to date. I don't believe I have been misguided in my intentions so far, The Curator for instance is the largest project that we have encountered as of yet and it is very important to me that there is a continuous work flow with it not just because of its size but also that others in the team may be dependant on my progress with it, hopefully at times even spurred on by it. Meanwhile I am not certain why I am putting off the Agile essay, perhaps it is because it has been such a long time since I have written an essay, or maybe I am a little too confident in my own writing. I suppose I will find out later this week and moreso after the initial draft feedback.

Week ten

Okay I should not have been at all confident in my writing. It's been too long since I have had to write anything formal and no matter how eloquent, or how proud of my spelling I am, the two writing assignments were a struggle for me. Meanwhile more assignments are due and it seems as if the curator is barely advancing at all.
